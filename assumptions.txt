There are a number of simplifying assumptions one can make about a standard Cribbage hand that can't be made in general.
These are largely to do with limited hand size, as well as cards in a deck.

In no particular order, for a 5-card scoring pool (4 hand or crib cards + starter) using a standard 52-card deck:

 1. There cannot be more than one run of length three or greater, unless is part of a longer run
    - this is because there are only 5 cards, and this would require 6 or more.

2. There cannot be more than 4 of a kind because each deck only has 4 of each rank.

3. There cannot be a pair / three of a kind / four of a kind / five of a kind all of a single suit because there is only one card of each suit+rank pair.



Pseudocode for pegging:

1. Check if each player has a valid card to play (will keep sum at or below 31)
    - if not, reset the sum and clear the list of played cards.
2. Players take turns playing cards, starting with the non-dealer.
- handle scoring, give points to the current player if they earned them
